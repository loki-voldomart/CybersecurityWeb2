- ✅ TypeScript for type safety
- ✅ Secure form handling

### Required Security Implementations
- ❌ **Authentication & Authorization**: Implement secure user authentication
- ❌ **Input Sanitization**: Add comprehensive input sanitization
- ❌ **Security Headers**: Configure security headers (CSP, HSTS, etc.)
- ❌ **Rate Limiting**: Implement API rate limiting
- ❌ **CSRF Protection**: Add CSRF token validation
- ❌ **SQL Injection Prevention**: Use parameterized queries
- ❌ **XSS Protection**: Implement XSS prevention measures
- ❌ **Secure Session Management**: Configure secure session handling
